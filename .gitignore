# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.

### We want to include this file.  Adding this after the *.lock flag ensures poetry.lock files are not ignored
